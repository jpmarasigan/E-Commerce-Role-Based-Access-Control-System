# E-Commerce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Overview

This project is an E-Commerce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System, designed to manage users, orders, products, and a MySQL database through an Admin and User interface. It offers two types of roles: **Admin** and **User**. The system allows the Admin to manage products, users, and orders, while the User can browse and place orders.

The application features a **Dashboard** for Admin users, where various metrics and data visualizations are shown using **Chart.js**. The backend is developed using **PHP**, **CSS** for frontend styling, **JavaScript** for interactivity, and **MySQL** (managed through XAMPP) for data storage.

  - Manage products: Add, update, delete product information.
